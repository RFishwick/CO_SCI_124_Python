Professor Pasha,\
\
I have a few questions on the Chapter 8 test:\
I tested these questions with the Python 3.6.4 interpreter:\
\
Question 4:\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf3 \cb4 If the start index is ________ the end index, the slicing expression will return an empty string.\
\
I chose \'93equal to\'94, however the given \'93Correct Answer\'94 was \'93greater than\'94\
My testing indicated both answers are true; the best answer would be \'93greater or equal to\'94 if it was available.  I was aware of this when I selected my answer.  While I see that the book states \'93I\cf3 \cb4 f the start index is greater than the end index, the slicing expression will return an empty string\'94, the statement \'93If the start index is equal to the end index, the slicing expression will return an empty string\'94 is also true.\
\cf3 \cb4 \
For example both of these return empty strings:\
city = 'New York'\
print('slice: ', city[5:5])\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \cb4 print('slice: ', city[5:4])\cf3 \cb4 \

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \cb1 \
\
Question 15:\
What will be assigned to s_string after the execution of the following code?\
special = '1357 Country Ln.'\
s_string = special[4:]\
\
I knew from testing that it will be ' Country Ln.\'92, however that answer was not available.\
I chose 'Country Ln.\'92 because it was the closest answer.\
The answer given as correct was: 
\fs28 \cf3 \cb4 \dn8 <img align="bottom" src="ppg/pearson/tm/sp3g/f22g1q3g2.gif"/>\
This points to some image I don\'92t have access to.  I don\'92t think we could reasonably assume this was the correct answer under the circumstances.\
\
I\'92ll admit I made a few dumb mistakes on this quiz, but I\'92d like to be given credit for the above two questions if possible.\
\
\
I also feel question 25 is a little beyond what was taught in chapter 8:\
True/False: If a whole paragraph is included in a single string, the split() method can be used to obtain a list of the sentences included in the paragraph.\
\

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \cf2 \cb1 \up0 I can see that split(\'91.\'92) would split up a paragraph into sentences, but only if they all ended in a period \'91.\'92  So this wouldn\'92t work if the paragraph had question marks \'91?\'92.  I understand there\'92s more complex solutions that would take care of multiple sentence separator types.\

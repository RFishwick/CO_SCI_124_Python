# Paint Job EstimatorÂ 
# A painting company has determined that for every 112 square feet of wall space,
# one gallon of paint and eight hours of labor will be required.
# The company charges $35.00 per hour for labor.
#
# Write a program that asks the user to enter the square feet
# of wall space to be painted and the price of the paint per gallon.
#
# The program should display the following data:
# The number of gallons of paint required
# The hours of labor required
# The cost of the paint
# The labor charge
# The total cost of the paint job

# Global constants
